# Neo4j Livedata [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

The goal of this package is to bring native graph support to Meteor applications

## Installation

DO NOT USE! This is not nearly complete.

## minineo4j

Eventually to be used with https://github.com/davidfurlong/minineo4j

## Neo4jCollection

Only a subset of the node-neo4j api has been integrated.

## Poll/Diff

The subscription model replicates the initial Meteor style of comparing data.

## Latency compensation

Not yet attempted.

## Supported commands

Right now only commands related to creating and retrieving nodes are supported; relationships
aren't complete yet, though work on mini-neo4j will allow us to do this soon.

## Known Issues

Right now it is known that the following things don't work:

- basically everything
- we've made a lot of progress, but haven't gotten as far as we planned

## Contributing

We could really do with some help. If you're interested, let us know!
